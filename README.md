This project produces the main results in the manuscript entitled "Fighting fire with fires: the fire-fuel feedback effect in Canadian forests".

1. Calculating NSDmax.R
This script derives number of realized spread days (NSD) for each fire event and annual maximum NSD (NSDmax) based on fire growth data.

2. PSD simulations.R
This script simulates the distributions of potential spread days (PSD).

3. Linking PSD and NSD.R
This script links PSD and NSD.

4. Static Dynamic Models.R
This script fits static and dynamic models of fire activity based on NSDmax.

5. Estimate PSDmax.R
This script generates annual maximum PSD (PSDmax) by periods, GCMs, and RCP scenarios for projections.

6. Project AAB-MFS-ANF.R
This script projects the full set of fire activity varaiables.

7. 2023 Comparison.R
This script compares the projections with the 2023 fire season.
